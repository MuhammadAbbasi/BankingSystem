# Banking System 🏦

A simple Python-based banking system I built while learning the language. This was one of my first projects, focused on practicing the basics of programming, structuring code, and handling simple data operations.

## Features ✨

* Create a new account with user details
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money (with balance checks)
* View account balance
* Exit the program gracefully

## Why this project? 🎯

This was my early attempt to move from writing small Python scripts to building a complete, working program. It helped me understand:

* How to use functions to structure code
* The importance of loops and conditionals in real programs
* Simple input/output handling
* Basics of state management in a running program

## Tech Stack 🛠

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Dependencies**: None (just the standard library)

## How to Run 🚀

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAbbasi/BankingSystem.git
   cd BankingSystem
   ```
2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python banking_system.py
   ```

## Sample Usage 🖥

```text
Welcome to the Banking System
1. Create Account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Check Balance
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
```

## Lessons Learned 📚

* Writing clean, reusable functions saves a lot of headaches
* Error handling is crucial (you never know what input users will type)
* Even a simple project can teach you how to think like a programmer

## Future Improvements 🔮

* Store account data in a file or database (so it persists after the program ends)
* Add account authentication (username/password)
* Support multiple accounts with unique IDs
